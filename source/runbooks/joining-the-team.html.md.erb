### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance](../team/alliance.html), and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Team tools

### Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom? Oh my!

Our main chat platform is Slack, our fallback option is Microsoft Teams.

We use Microsoft Teams for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls.

We rarely use Zoom, though some all-staff meetings are held on it.

For email we use the MoJ's Office365 Email.

For development work any IDE can be used, but many team members choose Visual Studio Code
