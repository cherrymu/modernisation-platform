## Overview

The core-logging AWS account is responsible for managing all core logging resources.

| Resource | Description |
|----------------- |------------------------------------------------
| S3 | Stores logs such as cloudtrail and core logging VPC flow logs
| KMS | Manages encryption keys used to securely encrypt the contents of S3 buckets
| PagerDuty | Hosts resources used by PagerDuty
| VPC | Provides networking resources
| Athena| Service to analyze log data stored in S3

## Steps
## 1. Account Creation 

Please note that aliases do not have a retention period. If an alias still exists under the same organizational unit, you cannot reuse the same alias. To prevent the alias from being recreated, you need to add the environment name to the [skip alias local](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/e9d5e14a25e5b0f4e544b26f0332e285e6c506a1/terraform/environments/bootstrap/member-bootstrap/locals.tf#L57).

To initiate the account recreation process, go to the GitHub Actions page for the Modernisation Platform repository and trigger the new environment [workflow] (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions/workflows/new-environment.yml).
This workflow should detect that the account no longer exists and propose to recreate the account. As part of this process, it will also execute the baseline runs for the account. 

## 2. Deploy Core Logging Production Resources

This can be achieved by triggering core-logging deployment workflow run, which can be [found here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/core-logging-deployment.yml).
Alternatively, this can be done as manual deployment: 
- Navigate to the `modernisation-platfom repo` and change to the `core-logging directory`
- Run `terraform plan` in the production workspace
- Using admin credentials, execute `terraform apply`

## 3. Verify Resources

- Log into AWS Console for the core-logging account
- Check and verify that resources have been correctly provisioned (KMS keys, S3, etc.)

## 4. Notify Mod Platform Team
- Inform Modernisation Platform team of rebuild process
- Inform customers that account has been recreated
