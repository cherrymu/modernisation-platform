## Feature description

This new feature allows to restrict access to resources based on the github team currently this is only implemented on the instance managment role and restricted to the core-shared-services account
it will allow users to create ec2 instances for there team that only that team can control, this is all ased on the aws documentation that can be read about [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/configure-aws-sso-abac-for-ec2-instances-and-systems-manager-session-manager).

## Where is the code

The code for this is located in the Modernisation platform repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/single-sign-on/policies.tf)
If you look at the code you will see that we are using a double negative condition to do the restriction and also restricting based on principle account that leave room to expand this out to other accounts if we need to
