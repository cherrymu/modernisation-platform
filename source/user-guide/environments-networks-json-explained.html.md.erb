## Overview

Our `core-vpc` terraform consumes the contents of our `environments-networks/*.json` files to populate local values used in the creation of resources.

This page explains how the options are used, with links to the relevant Terraform where possible.

## Template example

We maintain a template of the `environments-networks/*.json` files [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/main/environments-networks/template-only.txt).

## The `cidr` key

The `cidr` key defines values used in the creation of networking resources:

* `transit_gateway` has been deprecated as of [this pull request](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/1345).
* `protected` has likewise been deprecated as of [this pull request](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/pull/1345).
* `subnet_sets` key contains its own nested keys to define additional networking values.
  * Nested keys such as `general` provide further values that are consumed by the ["vpc"](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-vpc/vpc.tf#L85) module in `terraform/environments/core-vpc`.
    * `cidr` defines the network address to be used to create a VPC. This network address is further subdivided to create subnets in the VPC
    * `accounts` defines member account names associated with the relevant business unit.

## The `options` key

The `options` key defines values used in the creation of supplementary configuration items:

* `bastion_linux` is a boolean which determines if a business-unit bastion instance should be created
* `additional_cidrs` is used by the [vpc-nacls](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/modules/vpc-nacls) module to allow access from external CIDRs such as PSN address ranges.
* `additional_endpoints` is used by the [vpc](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-vpc/vpc.tf#L85) module in `terraform/environments/core-vpc` to supply VPC endpoint names.
* `additional_private_zones` is used by the [dns-zone-extend-private](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/modules/dns-zone-extend-private) module to create additional private DNS zones.

> In practice, `additional_private_zones` are created directly by customers, leveraging the `core-vpc` provider rather than defining them here.

* `additional_vpcs` is used by the [vpc-nacls](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/modules/vpc-nacls) module to allow access from internal CIDRs such as other Modernisation Platform address ranges.

> In practice, the use of `additional_vpcs` is something we want to avoid as we want to restrict the possibility of east/west traffic movement inside the Modernisation Platform.
