## Introduction

Each AWS account under the Modernisation Platform (MP) Organizational Unit (OU) has Security Hub enabled, and all findings are centralised into the **eu-west-2** region.

To receive the Security Hub severity summary in Slack, you need to:

- Add the Slack channel name as a tag in the `<application>.json` file in modernisation-platform repository
- Store the Slack webhook URL as a secret via the workflow

## Steps

### Add Security Hub Slack Channel Tag to `<application>.json`

In the `<application>.json` file, add or update the `securityhub-slack-channel` tag under `tags`

You can find your `<application>.json` file in the
[**modernisation-platform** repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments)
under the `environments/` folder.

#### Example

```json
"tags": {
  "application": "modernisation-platform",
  "business-unit": "Platforms",
  "securityhub-slack-channel": "modernisation-platform",
  "critical-national-infrastructure": false
}
```

### Trigger the Slack Webhook Workflow

After committing the updated JSON file, merge the PR. Then, manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to add or update the Slack webhook URL.

[Run the Update Securityhub Slack Secret Workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/actions/workflows/update-securityhub-slack-secret.yml)

Click on **"Run workflow"** and provide the following inputs:

- `Application name`: the name of your application (e.g., `modernisation-platform`)
- `Slack webhook URL`: the full Slack webhook URL (e.g., `<slack webhook url>`)

Once the workflow completes successfully, you will see the confirmation message:

```text
Slack channel <slack channel name> webhook added/updated in secret
```

### Daily Notification Job

A scheduled GitHub Actions job runs **daily** to send a summary of **Security Hub severity findings** to the Slack channel you specified in the tag.

The summary includes counts of findings by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) of the particular account

You can see an [example of the summary results here](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07SNBJBVC6).

**If you do not receive a daily message**, please raise an issue in [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1).
