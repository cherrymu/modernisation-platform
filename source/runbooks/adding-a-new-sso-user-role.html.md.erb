## Creating a New Role

You will need to raise pull requests in the [ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform) repository.

### Summary

You will need the following:

- An "aws_ssoadmin_permission_set"
- An "aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment"
- Any number of "aws_ssoadmin_managed_policy_attachment" 
- An "aws_ssoadmin_customer_managed_policy_attachment" that will correspond to an IAM policy
- An "aws_iam_policy" and "aws_iam_policy_document" to create the IAM policy for the new role
- Adjustments to the relevant `policies/environment/*.rego` files to check for the presence of the new role

### Setting up the role

Modernisation Platform SSO roles are defined in code [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/single-sign-on/).

You will need to raise a pull request that creates the following terraform resources:

- `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set` to create the role
- `aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment` to associate the role with Modernisation Platform accounts
- `aws_ssoadmin_managed_policy_attachment` to attach AWS managed IAM policies to the role
- `aws_ssoadmin_customer_managed_policy_attachment` to associate Modernisation Platform managed IAM policies to the role

### Setting up the IAM policy

Modernisation Platform IAM policies associated with SSO roles are defined in code [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/single-sign-on)

You will need to raise a pull request that creates the following terraform resources:

- `aws_iam_policy` to create the IAM policy.
    - The name should correspond to the name used in your `aws_ssoadmin_customer_managed_policy_attachment`
- `aws_iam_policy_document` to provide IAM policy statements for the new role

### Amending the OPA policy

OPA policy files are defined in code [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/policies).

You will need to raise a pull request that amends the following policy files:

- `collaborators.rego` to check which roles external collaborators can be granted
- `collaborators_test.rego` to run tests against allowed collaborator roles
- `environments.rego` to check which roles can be assigned in an `environments/*.json` file
- `environments_test.rego` to run tests against the allowed environments roles
