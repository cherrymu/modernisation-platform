## Introduction

The Modernisation Platform shares data from a number of sources with the Security Operations team's Coretext Xsiam platform for purpose of the protective monitoring of the platform and the applications hosted on it.

## Categories of data shared with Security Operations

The data is shared using AWS Data Firehose for the following categories of data:

- Managed member account VPC Flow Log Data via cloudwatch logs. 
- Route53 resolver logs for managed member accounts.
- Network firewall inspection log data for live, non-live and external.
- VPC flow log data for the three network firewall vpcs.
- VPC flow log data for core-shared-services, core-logging and core-security.

One exception is Cloudtrail log data in S3 held in the core-logging account. This is accessed by a Cortex Xsiam plugin for S3 using SQS that has events published via an Event Notification resource. The plugin uses an IAM user account to access the core-logging account.

## Terraform Sourece

The terraform for these Data Firehose & associated resources can be found here:

- Managed member account VPC flow log data - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/b629292a791bd8ce99b6bff6e0ddd888953cb76a/terraform/environments/core-vpc/vpc.tf#L85

- Route53 resolver logs for managed member accounts - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-vpc/firehose.tf

- Network firewall inspection log data - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/b629292a791bd8ce99b6bff6e0ddd888953cb76a/terraform/environments/core-network-services/firehose.tf#L17

- VPC flow log data for network firewalls - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/b629292a791bd8ce99b6bff6e0ddd888953cb76a/terraform/environments/core-network-services/firehose.tf#L30

- VPC flow log data for shared accounts:

        - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-logging/firehose.tf

        - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-security/firehose.tf

        - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-shared-services/firehose.tf

- Cloudtrail log data - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/terraform/environments/core-logging/sqs.tf

Each Data Firehose resource has an endpoint & key that is obtained from a common AWS Secrets Manager resource held in the Modernisation Platform account called "xsiam_secrets" for vpc flow logs, firewall logs and r53 resolver logs. 

## Known Maintenance Requirements

- The user access key for the IAM account needs to be rotated every 6 months and the new value shared with the SecOps team. See the runbook page for [Rotating Secrets](rotating-secrets.html.md.erb) for further information.
