### Configuration Overview

To effectively utilize AWS Lake Formation within the Modernization Platform and avoid permission errors and "nuke" failures, it is essential to configure your data lake administrators properly. Ensure the following two roles are included in your list of Data Lake Administrators:

*	CI user role for AWS Nuke purposes.

*	Sandbox role for your account.

Below is an example code snippet to guide you in setting up these roles:



```hcl

data "aws_iam_role" "github_actions_role" {
  name = "github-actions"
}

data "aws_iam_roles" "modernisation_platform_sandbox_role" {
  name_regex  = "AWSReservedSSO_modernisation-platform-sandbox_.*"
  path_prefix = "/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/"
}

resource "aws_lakeformation_data_lake_settings" "your_lake_settings_name" {
  admins = [
    "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/${data.aws_region.current.name}/${one(data.aws_iam_roles.modernisation_platform_sandbox_role.names)}",
     data.aws_iam_role.github_actions_role.arn
  ]
} 

```
