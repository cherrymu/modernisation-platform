## Introduction

We have a dedicated engineer to answer queries in the [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1) Slack channel and to respond to high priority incidents during the day.

Other engineers may also complete any of these activities at any time; all team members are encouraged to help where they can.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Dedicate an engineer to answer queries and respond to high-priority incidents
- **Channel**: [#ask-modernisation-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01A7QK5VM1)
- **Support Hours**: 9am-4pm (may extend based on engineer's workday)

## Rota Management

- Team members self-assign rota days
- Rota is visible [here](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/msteams_480621/Shared%20Documents/General/MilkMonitor.xlsx?d=w98123f55d1904b36bde823db8dbc9a0f&csf=1&web=1&e=1foadk)
- Avoid rota duty if day is full of meetings or other commitments
- Maximum 3 days per sprint for any individual
- Communicate absences for coverage
