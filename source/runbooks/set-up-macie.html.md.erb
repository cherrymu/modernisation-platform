# Introduction

It is relatively easy to set up Macie for users and it need to be done on an account by account basis. **NOTE** Macie ONLY looks at S3 buckets and checks their access information so it will not look at databases or EC2 settings, for example. 

To do this you should connect to the environment on which you want to create Macie. Note, for accounts with 4 versions (development, test, preproduction, production) you will need to create Macie on each one. In theory you can just set it up in each account and allow one (day production) to use every account to access their data. At the time this document was produced this was not tested but can be used according to an AWS video showing a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8piwEQJJXdo).

AWS also have a brief outline of the purpose of [Macie](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/what-is-macie.html) which can be checked to see if this is suitable.  

# To start Macie

Initially this will show the "how to" on the console. There will be links to the terraform code required at the end. It will need to be set up wth terraform to prevent it being disabled or removed when terraform is run in the future. The code is not show in detail in these instructions.

Connect to the account you want to use with AdministratorAccess.

Access the Amazon Macie choice and click on "Get started". 

*Initially it will set up a 30 day trial, which may be useful to look at possible costs of using the service. If you want to disable the trial connect to the settings page and look to the disable option and select the Disable option, type Disable in the box and click Disable. This will stop the Macie access.*

Following the Get started choice a window will be available to see what access is needed. I would recommend that the details in here are copied and saved in case you need to give the required access later.

At this point you will then be asked if you want to Enable Macie. Click the button if you do.

As part of the initial trial there will be an option to see what the costs will be by looking at the Usage page. If you have large S3 buckets this may appear quite costly.

## Set up jobs

Jobs can be set up on the console quite simply. There is a message about not having an S3 bucket to push the changes to but that can be ignored for the most part. It is suggested that you crete one. To do this you will need to add some code or amend that which is in place. The document [here](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/macie-s3-kms-permission) explains what is needed. Most importantly ensure that the correct arn is in place on both the S3 and JMS key files as well as following the instructions shown.

Under get started there is an option to create a job. Specify the buckets if only connecting to one account but pick the criteria if more that one account is going to be looked at. Once set work through each of the screens. 

If you want something to *run regularly (daily, weekly or monthly)* pick that option on screen 3, otherwise select a *one-time* job.

On screen 5 you can select custom data identifiers but these need to be set up first. Picking the option to set these up will open a new screen.

Screen 6 shows allow lists. Again they need to be set up beforehand but can be created through another screen.

The 7th screen makes you enter a job name and, if you want, add tags. The job name MUST be entered.

The final screen lists the selected buckets and gives (under the free trial at least) an estimated cost. You can also amend any of the previous settings here.

If you list the jobs you can see if it is running and the results will appear on the Findings screen once it completes. Note, it may take some time to give results. On our example buckets, which are small, it takes over 15 minutes at least initially.


# Terraform code

Note the items shown here are not actual detailed Terraform code but examples of how to set things up. To get more detail it is best to do a search for ["aws macie terraform"](https://www.google.com/search?q=aws+macie+terraform&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&oq=&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxjCAzIJCAAQRRg7GMIDMgkIARBFGDsYwgMyCQgCEEUYOxjCAzIJCAMQRRg7GMIDMgkIBBBFGDsYwgMyCQgFEEUYOxjCAzIJCAYQRRg7GMIDMgkIBxBFGDsYwgPSAQkzMTE4ajBqMTWoAgiwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
