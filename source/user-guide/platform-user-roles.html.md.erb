The Modernisation Platform offers a selection of user roles to suit different use cases.

These are [defined in code](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/terraform/environments/bootstrap/single-sign-on) and supplied through [single sign-on](../concepts/environments/single-sign-on.html).

## Modernisation Platform Roles

### view-only

- Log into the console
- See resources and basic metadata. You cannot see the content of resources such as logs or S3 buckets.


### read-only

- Log into the console
- Comprehensive read-only visibility of the AWS environment. As this role provides access to contents of S3 and others, it is designed for users for whom view-only is insufficient.
- Role makes use of AWS ReadOnly managed policy and is not at present configurable beyond that.

### sandbox

The sandbox access can only be used on a development environment account.

- Log into the console
- Same console read and write permissions as the pipelines have
- This permission can only be attached to development accounts
- Once a week the account will be cleared with AWS Nuke and then rebuilt from Terraform
- The idea of sandbox access is that it gives you the freedom to experiment and modify things in the console to assist with creating your Terraform code.

Anything not in code will be lost at the end of the week.
